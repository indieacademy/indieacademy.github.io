  <h1>Philosophy</h1>
  <h6>Mon, Feb 27, 2017</h6>
  

<h1 id="philosophy">Philosophy</h1>

<p>More than anything else, this writing reflects the way I think and see the world. It’s the best version of myself.</p>

<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now. – Chinese Proverb</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wanted to found a startup, so I did. We joined one of the top accelerators in the US and were about to raise money. It hit me when I realized the insanity of trying to sell a piece of my company to go down the road that is predicated on raising C after B after A. Aggressive standards applied to every company knowing 9 out 10 will fail. I was already working for someone else’s Vision before even starting to create the environment that I believed in so much.</p>

<p>My goals are simple: Be 100% independent from money, time and physical location and create high quality products while working in areas that I enjoy. When I turn 90 I know that time is the single most important resource that I wish I optimized on. Then i imagined my funeral and thought about what the 3 most important people in my life would say about me. I now know what to do.</p>

<h2 id="vision">Vision</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Logic will get you from A to Z; imagination will get you everywhere. - Albert Einstein</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I want to create a psychological safe community where impressive individuals across the globe can connect to realize their vision. Don’t let your vision be dictated from any other entity but your pure mind. I am opinionated and core commandments of this vision are:</p>

<p>We…</p>

<p><strong>do whatever we want in life</strong>
Stop being a passive observer of your life and act.
<strong>work independently from time and location</strong>
Escape modern prisons and be free.
<strong>learn new things to a level of mastery</strong>
Combine skills to let magic happen.
<strong>approach problems with a beginners mindset</strong>
Don’t apply solutions, de-construct problems.
<strong>generate real recurring revenue from our business</strong>
Money can buy independence and is a means to an end.
<strong>create high quality products</strong>
Lets build great things or leave it.
<strong>are enabled and enable others</strong>
Create a winning environment.
<strong>don’t just check boxes but think and add value</strong>
Think long to generate innovate ideas.
<strong>apply a hacker mindset</strong>
Break things, think out of the box and create systems.
<strong>don&rsquo;t look for the shortcut</strong>
It’s a long and sometimes painful process.
<strong>sustain a healthy lifestyle</strong>
You can’t split your physical and mental health.
<strong>create for a world in the future</strong>
Don’t think now, think in 20 years.
<strong>are positive and don’t get defensive</strong>
Don’t complain, change it.
<strong>don’t try. Do or do not</strong>
There is no try.
<strong>are always awesome</strong>
Every activity trains your brain and forms the synapsis, train awesome, don’t train mediocre.
<strong>get to value as soon as possible</strong>
Optimize time to value.
<strong>unlearn toxic patterns</strong>
We all learned many bad things, lets unlearn.
<strong>are not afraid to fail</strong>
Imagine the worst thing that can happen? Not that bad, huh?
<strong>are open-minded and change perspective</strong>
Take on another perspective, how does the world look like?
<strong>give and take feedback in a respectful manner</strong>
Reflect and become self-aware.
<strong>are open and transparent</strong>
What do you want to hide? Why?
<strong>are not afraid of showing vulnerability</strong>
Vulnerability is real and creates credibility.
<strong>act in a way we won’t regret</strong>
When you are 90, will you regret what you’ve done?
<strong>are willing to adapt and change</strong>
It is not the strongest […] it is the one that is most adaptable to change. - Darwin
<strong>experiment with different ideas and different domains</strong>
Get out of your comfort zone.
<strong>keep a lean mindset</strong>
Analysis paralysis kills you. Be lean. Don’t over engineer.
<strong>challenge ourselves and actively rewire our brains</strong>
Don’t take the status quo for granted.
<strong>enjoy life and have fun</strong>
YOLO.
<strong>limit the time and add constraints</strong>
Stop procrastinating and focus on essentials to get more done.
<strong>don’t find excuses</strong>
Take adversity head on.
<strong>solve real problems</strong>
Make something you can sell, not the other way around.
<strong>think globally and act locally</strong>
Focus on small wins. Build momentum. Then conquer.
<strong>create experiments and validate first</strong>
Otherwise the entire project becomes and experiment.
<strong>have balls &amp; not business plans</strong>
Do it, don’t write another business plan.
<strong>want to be among the top 2</strong>
Nobody remembers the 3rd.
<strong>celebrate failures &amp; enjoy our journey</strong>
It’s the journey and the grind, not the destination.
<strong>are accountable to someone</strong>
Accountability creates results.
<strong>think fast and slow</strong>
Breathe. Think. Analyze. Act informed.
<strong>target a specific narrow audience</strong>
Be the best choice for your audience.
<strong>give before we ask</strong>
Give first, give again, then ask.
<strong>lead by example</strong>
Show don’t tell.
<strong>act out of love, not anxiety</strong>
Always act out of love, not fear.
<strong>focus</strong>
Work on one thing at a time, and one thing only.
<strong>over deliver and delight</strong>
The expected is mediocre.
<strong>use data to inform our decisions</strong>
Instinct is good, data is better.
<strong>don’t bullshit</strong>
Just don’t.
<strong>think and act 10x</strong>
Create something an order of magnitude better.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In a world that is changing so quickly the biggest risk you can take is not taking any risk. - Mark Zuckerberg</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was a willful decision to start as a solopreneur. Here is why:</p>

<ul>
<li>No communication overhead and associated costs.</li>
<li>Time constraints help me to focus and eliminate.</li>
<li>Accountability buddies and mentors fill the team gap.</li>
<li>Creating a real business not a job.</li>
<li>Highest level of automation and efficiency required and desired.</li>
<li>Independence from money, time and location.</li>
</ul>

<p>I hope that my statements raised some questions. Please ask.</p>
